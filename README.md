# S4 grating

A 1D grating in [S<sup>4</sup>](https://web.stanford.edu/group/fan/S4/)

## Simple
* Run the grating simulation with `S4 grating.lua`
* `grating.lua` saves incident, transmitted and reflected intensity to `spectrum.txt`
* Plot `spectrum.txt` with your favourite plotting software 
    * or `python plot_spectrum.py`

#
## Advanced

## Python launch
* Run the grating simulation with `python launch.py`
* The simulation saves incident, transmitted and reflected intensity to `spectrum.txt`
* Plot the data as above

## Parallel python launch
* Run the grating simulation with `python parallel_launch.py`
* The simulation saves incident, transmitted and reflected intensity to `spectrum.txt`
* Plot the data as above
